# Model Local Training App

This app, together with the [model_aggregator](https://github.com/OpenMined/model_aggregator) app, form a semi-FL app using SyftBox, where the participants train their models locally and the aggregator aggregates the models to improve the global model accuracy.

Please refer to the `README.md` for information on running the apps.
